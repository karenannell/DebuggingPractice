# DebuggingPractice
This is a set of codes that I created to help students understand bugs, including how to identify and fix common issues in Python.
For each activity, the student must identify the specified number of bugs and fix them accordingly. Files with ".buggy" are those that have bugs, while files without this label are the original scripts.
